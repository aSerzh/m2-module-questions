The Questions module for Magento 2 provides functionality that allows customers to ask questions to store administrators. Customers can view approved questions and answers on a separate page, as well as receive email notifications about received answers to their question. Administrators can answer questions through the admin panel interface (the admin receives an email notification when a new question is received), manage them, approve or reject them (rejected questions are deleted on a cron schedule), and view and edit answers.
